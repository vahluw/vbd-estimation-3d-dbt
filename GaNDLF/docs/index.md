# GaNDLF

The **G**ener**a**lly **N**uanced **D**eep **L**earning **F**ramework (GaNDLF) for reproducible segmentation and classification.

## Why use GaNDLF?
GaNDLF was developed to lower the barrier to AI, enabling reproducibility, translation, and deployment.
As an out-of-the-box solution, GaNDLF alleviates the need to build from scratch. Users may kickstart their project
by modifying only **a configuration (config) file** that provides guidelines for the envisioned pipeline
and **CSV inputs** that describe the training data.

## Range of GaNDLF functionalities:
- Supports multiple
    - Deep Learning model architectures
    - Channels/modalities 
    - Prediction classes
- Robust data augmentation, courtesy of [TorchIO](https://github.com/fepegar/torchio/) and [Albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations)
- Built-in cross validation, with support for parallel HPC-based computing
- Multi-GPU (on the same machine) training
- Leverages robust open source software
- *Zero*-code needed to train robust models
- *Low*-code requirement for customization
- [Automatic mixed precision](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) support
