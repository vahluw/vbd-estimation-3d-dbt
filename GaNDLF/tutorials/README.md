## Tutorials for GaNDLF

This directory contains tutorials for GaNDLF.

Here are some of the tutorials that are available:

1. Classification using MEDMNIST Pathology images in a notebook: https://github.com/mlcommons/GaNDLF/tree/master/tutorial/classification_medmnist_notebook


## Adding new tutorials

### Jupyter Notebook based tutorials

- Create a new directory and replicate the instructions for the [MEDMNIST Pathology tutorial](https://github.com/mlcommons/GaNDLF/tree/master/tutorials/classification_medmnist_notebook). This should create a fully-functional tutorial that can be run by anyone, either on Codespaces, or Colab, or locally.
- Ensure that the notebook is saved with the output cells, so that the output can be seen without running the notebook.
- Add any relevant information directly in the notebook.

### Markdown based tutorials

Create a new directory for the tutorial, and add a README.md file in it. The README.md file should contain the following sections:

- Introduction
- Prerequisites
- Obtaining the data
- Running the tutorial
- Expected output
- Troubleshooting
- References - if any
